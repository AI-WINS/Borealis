### Abstract
Today, the standard for user-oriented commercial millimeter-wave (mmwave) radar solutions utilize a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) transmission signal to obtain highly accurate range information (range resolutions at the centimeter-level). Conveniently, the same information used to estimate range can, when viewed over multiple modulation cycles, also allow the radar sensor to estimate target velocity (doppler). Viewing frame by frame range-doppler plots allows these systems to perform classification of complex human gestures. \\
Over the last few years, a new class of mmwave radar systems utilizing pulse modulated continuous wave (PMCW) transmission signals have arrived on the consumer market. Since a PMCW chip can exhibit a period much shorter than a standard FMCW chirp, these new radar systems enable much finer range and doppler resolutions (range resolutions at the millimeter-level). Consequently, classification of more sophisticated and subtle gestures should be able to be achieved. This senior research thesis explores the human gesture recognition capabilities of these new PMCW radar systems compared to that of the FMCW radars that preceded it.
